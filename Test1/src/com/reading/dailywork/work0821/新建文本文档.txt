The reading passage presents three arguments to prove that Peary did reach North Pole, but the lecture attacks the argument one by one. 
First, the article contends that the commette conducted an investigation of Peary's records and equipments, concluding that his accounts were trustworthy. However, the lecturer points out that the committee who was composed of Peary's close friends and funded his trip was not completely objective. Besides, Peary himself said that the investigation did not examine his records carefully, since the investigation only lasted two days. Therefore, its conclusions are not trustworthy.
Second, the reading materials mantains that Peary's claims are possible because a British explorer completed the same trek within 37 days as Peary had, while the professor refutes that Tom Avery carried less than Peary did although their sled were similar. To be specific, Avery's food was dropped along the way by airplane because he did not carry food. Besides, unlike Avery encountered favorable weather condition, Peary travelled in unfavorable condition.
Third, the writer holds that the sun's position in Peary's photographs correspond to the right position as it should have been. To counter this statement, the lecturer casts doubt on wheter the measurement of the shadow is precise since Peary used a primitive camera which can take only fuzzy and slightly unfocused photographs which have been faded and therefore can't be use to calculate the sun's position with the great accuracy. So these photographs might not be taken in the North Pole.
