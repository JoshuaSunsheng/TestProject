The reading passage presents three arguments to prove that Peary did reach the North Pole, but the lecture attacks the argument one by one. 

First, the article contends that a committee conducted an investigation of Peary's records and equipment, concluding that his accounts were convincing. However, the lecture points out that the committee who was composed of his friends and funded Peary's trip was not completely objective. Besides, Peary himself said that the committee did not examine his records carefully since the investigation lasted only two-days. Therefore, its conclusions are not trustworthy.

Second, the reading material maintains that Peary's claims are possible because a british explorer completed the same trek within 37 days just as Peary had, while the professor refutes that Tom Avery carried much less weight than Peary did although their sleds were similar. To be specific, Tom Avery's food was dropped along the way by airplane since he did not carry food. Besides, unlike Avery who encountered favorable weather conditions, peary travelled in unfavorable conditions.

Third, the writer holds that the Sun's position in Peary's photographs corresponds to the right position as it should have been. To counter this statement, the lecturer expresses doubts on whether the measurement of the shadows is precise since Peary used a primitive camera which only took fuzzy  and slightly unfocused photographs which have become faded and therefore annot be used to calculate the Sun's position with great accuracy. So these photos might not be taken at the North Pole.
